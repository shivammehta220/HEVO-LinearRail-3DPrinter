# Design
Before building the HEVO, a CAD model of the printer was created using Autodesk Fusion 360. This step was instrumental in ensuring accurate frame dimensions and assisting in the design of upgrades.

## Extrusion
Instead of manually cutting the 3030 extrusion, which can introduce dimensional errors and lead to an uneven frame, I opted to have the individual extrusions laser-cut by MISUMI. The cost was reasonable, and the peace of mind in achieving a squared frame made it well worth it. The hardware for the frame and components were sourced from various online retailers and are all listed in the Bill of Materials (BOM) sheet.

| Extrusion (mm) | Type | Quantity |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 420 | 3030 Black Alu profiles | 6 |
| 410 | 3030 Black Alu profiles | 8 |
| 700 | 3030 Black Alu profiles | 4 |
| 415 | 2020 Black Alu profiles | 2 |
| 235 | 2020 Black Alu profiles | 2 |

## Linear Rail
To enhance the printer's performance, the original linear rod rails were upgraded to linear rails. This improvement was achieved by utilizing a project found at [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2839395]. Additionally, a custom bracket was designed to mount the Trianglelab BMG extruder + V6 Hotend.

## CAD and STL
The repository provides the complete assembly CAD, including the frame design and any custom-designed components. Additionally, STL files for all the printed parts are included and organized in folders. Various components and features in the design were sourced from online platforms such as Thingiverse.
