# Octoprint
OctoPrint is a web interface for remotely controlling and monitoring the printer, and in this project, it is hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4. The Raspberry Pi can be equipped with various accessories, which can be accessed through the web interface, allowing for convenient control and monitoring of the printer. Here are some of the plugins used in this build:
